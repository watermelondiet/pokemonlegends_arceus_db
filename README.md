# OVERVIEW
The following is personal project created for evaluating the relative strengths and weaknesses of various Pokemon in the new Pokemon Legends: Arceus game for Nintendo Switch. It incorporates elements of SQL and R programming languages in data aggregation and analysis.

Many similar databases of Pokemon stats exist, but Arceus introduces several new Pokemon whose stats could not be found in existing databases. I will scrape data on the new Pokemon from spoilers posted on the web and join them to an existing database such that the end result includes only those Pokemon available for capture in Arceus gameplay. My analysis will be limited to the current game and to start, it will be focused on identifying the best choice in starter Pokemon.

I'll update this README as the project comes together.
